# Python Error Debugging Examples

This repository contains small, focused examples of common Python errors and how to fix them. Each pair of files shows a **buggy version** that raises an exception, and a **fixed version** that handles the problem correctly.

## Examples

- `buggy_division.py` / `fixed_division.py`  
  - Demonstrates `ZeroDivisionError` and how to handle invalid input safely.

- `buggy_file_reader.py` / `fixed_file_reader.py`  
  - Demonstrates `FileNotFoundError` and how to use `with` and basic error handling.

These are simplified examples I use to practice and demonstrate Python debugging techniques and exception handling.
